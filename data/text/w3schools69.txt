People who create websites and web applications for a living, are called Front-End Developers. Tip: Many Front-End Developers also have basic knowledge of different CSS and JavaScript frameworks and libraries, like Bootstrap, SASS (CSS pre-processor), jQuery and React, and the popular version control system, Git. What About Back-End? Front-end development refers to the client-side (how a web page looks). Back-end development refers to the server-side (how a web page works). Front-end code is used to create static websites, where the purpose is to display the web page. However, if you want to make your website dynamic (manage files and databases, add contact forms, control user-access, etc.), you need to learn a back-end programming language, like PHP or Python, and use SQL to communicate with databases. A list of other popular languages can be found on our Homepage. ❮ Home Next ❯ NEW We just launched W3Schools videos Explore now COLOR PICKER Get certified by completing a course today! w3schools CERTIFIED . 2022 Get started CODE GAME Play Game Report Error Forum About Buy Certificate × Report Error If you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, do not hesitate to send us an e-mail: help@w3schools.com × Thank You For Helping Us!
